# Next Steps

Prioritized continuation plan. The top item is always the next thing to do. Update at the end of every session.

## Owner actions (do not block development)

1. Done 2026-11-13: the owner has a sign-in for the demo store. More staff: `pnpm admin:create --email someone@example.com --name "Name" --tenant demo --role store_manager`. Password-reset emails arrive at http://localhost:8025 in development.
2. The GitHub repository is currently **public**. Make it private in the repository settings if that is not intended.
3. Review the default role permissions (decision D24 in DECISIONS.md): who can refund, launch ads, run giveaway draws, export or delete customers.
4. Answer what you can in the open decisions table in DECISIONS.md.

## Next development task: Milestone 2.6, storefront SEO and Phase 2 wrap-up

See PROJECT_PLAN.md section 4 (Phase 2). Product pages already have a canonical address, link-preview tags and structured data.

1. `sitemap.xml` per store (home, categories, published products; paged when large) and `robots.txt` (allow the shop; disallow `/admin`, `/cart`, `/search`).
2. Canonical addresses and link-preview tags for the home, category and all-products pages; filtered and paged lists point at their unfiltered first page or are marked noindex.
3. The store's name in page titles (today: "Store").
4. A storefront 404 page inside the shop's shell, with links back to shopping.
5. Performance pass on a phone profile: image sizes, layout shift, what blocks first paint; record the numbers in docs.
6. Tests: sitemap lists only published products of the right store; robots rules; canonical tags.

## Then, in order

| Order | Milestone | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 3.1 to 3.8 Checkout and operations | 3.4 needs payment provider test keys |
| 3 | Launch hardening pulled forward from Phase 10 | Backups, monitoring, proxy configuration for client addresses |

Later phases follow PROJECT_PLAN.md section 4, adjusted by the owner's priorities.

## Small follow-ups carried forward

- Cart: worker job to delete carts that expired (they are ignored today, not removed).
- Cart: link a cart to a signed-in customer and merge the guest cart (with customer accounts, Phase 3).
- Cart: a small "added" panel with the picture, and a cart drawer, as enhancements over the page.
- Cart: abandoned-cart reminders need consent and customer contact details (Phase 4 marketing).

- Product page: zoom on the main picture; video; a size guide; previous and next buttons on the gallery for mouse users.
- Product page: gate the "recently viewed" cookie behind the consent choice once the banner exists (decision D49).
- Product page: show stock wording and availability in structured data once inventory exists (Milestone 3.2).
- Sort drop-down: a choice made in the instant before the page's script attaches is not submitted (the browser tests retry; without JavaScript a "Sort" button is shown).

- Storefront: admin screen to choose and order home page sections (today: Featured, New arrivals, Best sellers from the product flags).
- Storefront: filters by size and material; a price slider; infinite scroll as an enhancement over paging.
- Storefront: search suggestions and "did you mean"; synonyms; searching specification values.
- Storefront: caching of category and home pages (every page renders on request today).
- Storefront: translated interface text and right-to-left layout when the store's languages are decided (open decision).

- Media: cleanup job for files in storage that no row points to (left behind only if storage was unreachable during a delete; each case is logged).
- Media: drag-and-drop ordering and upload progress per file (buttons work today); crop or focal point.
- Media: background removal and video, behind the existing interfaces (with content tools, Phase 6).
- Media: production needs a public-read rule for `public/*` on the bucket (see `docker/storage-public-read-policy.json`) and ideally a CDN; set `S3_PUBLIC_URL` to it.

- Catalog: bulk import and export (CSV), duplicate a product, reorder variants, and a list filter by category.
- Catalog: length, width and height are stored per variant but not yet in the form.
- Catalog: `/api/v1/admin` endpoints for products (the admin pages use server actions; the API is needed for integrations and the AI tools in Phase 5).
- Catalog: stop a variant being deleted once an order refers to it (with orders, Milestone 3.3).

- Screen for the tenant setting "require two-factor for owners and managers" (with store settings, Milestone 3.7). Until then: `UPDATE tenants SET require_staff_two_factor = true WHERE slug = '…'`.
- Store selection within a tenant, and enforcing a membership's `store_ids`, when a tenant can have several stores.

- Staff invitation and management screens (with settings, Milestone 3.7 at the latest).
- Scheduled cleanup of expired sessions and verification tokens (worker job).
- Email notification when a password is changed or two-factor is switched off.
- Pin Docker image versions (currently `latest` for RustFS, Mailpit and the AWS CLI helper).
- Add a Dockerfile for web and worker (with launch hardening).
- Set `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` for builds if the owner wants Next.js anonymous telemetry off.

## Things to start early because they take calendar time

- Meta developer app, business verification and app review (Phase 6).
- TikTok developer app and audit (Phase 6).
- Payment provider account approval, including the giveaway question (docs/COMPLIANCE.md section 1).
- Domain purchase and transactional email domain setup (a real email provider is needed before launch).
